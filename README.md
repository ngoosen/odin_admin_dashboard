# Odin exercise: Admin dashboard

This project is part of the [Odin's Project](https://github.com/TheOdinProject) *Intermediate HTML and CSS* course.

The goal here is to create a very common website layout using our newly acquired knowledge of grid, in association with flexbox.

See live example [here](https://ngoosen.github.io/odin_admin_dashboard/).
